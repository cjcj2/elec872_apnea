# elec872_apnea
Python files used both locally and in Google Colab to preprocess and train model for detecting sleep apnea.
File paths would need to be changed for use by others. 
For example, since preprocessing_step1 was run locally, it uses terminal to run, while other files don't since they were on Colab.
